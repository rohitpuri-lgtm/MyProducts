# Product List App

A React Native app that displays products from DummyJSON API
 with search, category filters, and lazy loading.

#  üéØ Objective

Create a product listing interface that:

Fetches products from a fake API

Displays them in a grid

Supports search and category-based filtering

Implements infinite scroll (lazy loading) for smooth performance

‚úÖ Features

‚úÖ Display products in a grid layout

‚úÖ Search functionality to find products by name

‚úÖ Filter products by category

‚úÖ Infinite scroll (lazy loading) to load more products as the user scrolls

‚úÖ FlatList performance optimizations:

initialNumToRender

removeClippedSubviews

getItemLayout

# ‚ö° Concepts Covered

React Native FlatList usage and optimization

API integration with DummyJSON

Search and filter logic
